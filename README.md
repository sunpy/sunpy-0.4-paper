SunPy Papers
============

This is the attempt to write a SunPy paper for submission, firstly, if we get a
talk at SciPy 2013, and failing that at a later date.

The proceedings of SciPy 2013 are being submitted to Computational Science and
Discovery, which is what this LaTeX template is taken from.
