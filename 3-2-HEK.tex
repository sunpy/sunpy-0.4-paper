\subsection{HEK}\label{ssec:hek}

The Sun is an active star and exhibits a wide range of transient phenomena (e.g. flares, 
radio burst) on many 
different time-scales, length-scales and wavelengths. Observations and metadata 
concerning these phenomena are collected at the Heliophysics Event 
Knowledgebase (HEK).  Entries are generated both by automated algorithms and 
human observers.  Some of the information in the HEK reproduces feature/event 
data elsewhere (for example, the GOES flare catalog), and some is generated by 
the Solar Dynamics Observatory Feature Finding Team \cite{martens2012} to
populate the HEK.  The advantage of the HEK is it provides a homogeneous and 
well-described interface to a large 
amount of feature/event information of interest to the solar physics community.

SunPy accesses this information through the \texttt{hek} module, which was 
developed with support from the European Space Agency Summer of Code in 
Space (ESA-SOCIS) 2011.  The \texttt{hek} module makes use of the HEK API
(\url{http://vso.stanford.edu/hekwiki/ApplicationProgrammingInterface?action=print}).
The current list of 
events maintained by the HEK and their properties can be found at 
\url{http://www.lmsal.com/hek/VOEvent_Spec.html}.

Simple HEK queries consist of start time, an end time, and an event type 
(Listing \ref{code:hek:simple}). Event types are specified as upper case, 
two letter strings, and are 
identical to the two letter abbreviations found at the HEK website, 
\url{http://www.lmsal.com/hek/VOEvent_Spec.html}.

The module \texttt{hek.attrs} contains attributes of the HEK that can be used to
construct HEK queries.  For example, a flare is an attribute of the HEK, and so 
instead of specifying \texttt{hek.attrs.EventType('FL')} in Listing 
\ref{code:hek:simple}, this can also be expressed as \texttt{hek.attrs.FL}. 

HEK attributes differ from VSO attributes (Section \ref{ssec:vso}) in that many 
of them are wrappers that conveniently expose comparisons by overloading Python 
operators.  This allows filtering of the HEK entries by the properties of the 
event.  As was mentioned above, the HEK stores feature/event metadata obtained 
in different ways, known generally as {\it feature recognition methods} ( 
FRMs). Example \ref{code:hek:frm} filters the results of the previous result to 
return only those events that have the FRM 'SSW Latest Events'.
\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg]{pycon}
>>> result = client.query(hek.attrs.Time(tstart,tend), 
                      hek.attrs.EventType(event_type),
                      hek.attrs.FRM.Name == 'SSW Latest Events')
>>> len(result)
9
\end{minted}
\caption{An HEK query that returns only those flares that were
  detected by the 'SSW Latest Events' feature recognition method.}
\label{code:hek:frm}
\end{listing}
Multiple comparisons can be made by including more comma-separated
conditions on the attributes in the call to the HEK query method.

HEK comparisons can be combined using Python’s logical operators e.g. AND
and OR. This makes complex queries easy to create: Listing \ref{code:hek:or} 
returns flares west of 50 arcseconds or those that have a peak flux above 
1000.0 (the units of the flux are FRM dependent and are described at the HEK 
website).
\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg]{python}
>>> result = client.query(hek.attrs.Time(tstart,tend), 
...                       hek.attrs.EventType(event_type),
...                       (hek.attrs.Event.Coord1 > 50) 
...                       or (hek.attrs.FL.PeakFlux > 1000.0))
\end{minted}
\caption{HEK query using the 'or' operator.}
\label{code:hek:or}
\end{listing}
All FRMs report the required feature attributes (as described at 
\url{http://www.lmsal.com/hek/VOEvent_Spec.html}), but the optional attributes 
are FRM dependent.  If a FRM does not have one of the optional attribute, a 
'None' is returned by the \texttt{hek} module. 

The ability to use comparison and logical operators on HEK attributes allows 
the construction of queries of almost arbitrary complexity. 
It is also possible to use the 
results of a HEK query to download the corresponding data from the VSO by using 
SunPy's \texttt{H2VClient}.
%schriste - this is a weird way to end this section, either show how it is done or 
% do not mention it, i think.
