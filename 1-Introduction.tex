\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}

Science is driven by the analysis of data. Modern advances in sensor
technology, combined with the availability of inexpensive storage has led to
rapid increases in amount of data available to scientists in almost
every discipline.  Solar physics is no exception to this trend. For example, NASA's
AIA instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite, launched in February 2010,
produces over 1 TB of catalogued and stored data per day \citep{aia}. Managing and
analysing this mountain of data
requires increasingly sophisticated software tools.  Key qualities
that these tools should have include robustness, ease of use, a
transparent development history, ease of modification, and conformance
to standards.  Software with these qualities provide a strong
foundation and can support the needs of the community as data
volumes grow and science questions evolve.
%schriste - the opening paragraph still needs work
%ji - I had a go.
%schriste - looks good, made a small fix

SunPy aims to provide a free, open-source and openly developed software package 
for the analysis and visualisation of solar data. SunPy makes use of the Python 
programming language and the scientific Python packages. Python is a general-purpose, 
powerful and easy-to-learn high-level programming language.
% RJH: Can we cut the next sentence?  It seems superfluous and top 10 is rather
% meaningless.
% schriste - i think it's important. it contrasts nicely with IDL and its tiny 
%community.
%SJM: I think it should stay, it makes a point.
According to the \href{http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html}{2014 TIOBE Index},
 it is one of the top ten most popular programming languages in the world 
and is widely used outside of scientific fields in areas like web development, education 
and `big data' analytics.


The development of a package such as SunPy is made possible by the 
rich ecosystem of scientific packages available in Python. Core packages such 
as \texttt{NumPy}, \texttt{SciPy} and \texttt{matplotlib} 
provide the basic functionality expected of a scientific programming language,
e.g., array manipulation, core numerical algorithms and visualisation. 
Building upon these foundations, packages such as \texttt{astropy}, \texttt{pandas} and 
\texttt{scikit-image} provide more domain-specific functionality.

SunPy is designed to be a clean, simple-to-use, and well-structured 
package that provides the \textit{core} tools for solar data analysis. 
The primary focus of SunPy's early development are 
specialised data types that allow the acquisition, processing and 
visualisation of all types of solar data.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of SunPy's current 
capabilities, an overview of the project's development model, community aspects of the 
SunPy project, as well as future plans. The latest release of SunPy, version 0.4,
can be downloaded from \href{http://sunpy.org}{www.sunpy.org} or can be
installed using the \href{http://pypi.python.org/pypi}{Python package index}.
