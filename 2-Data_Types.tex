\section{Core Data Types}\label{sec:DataTypes}

Currently, SunPy provides data structures that are specifically designed for the
three primary varieties of solar physics data: images, time series, and
spectra. SunPy provides core data types for these using Python classes:
\texttt{Map} (2D spatial data), \texttt{LightCurve} (1D temporal series)
and \texttt{Spectrum} and \texttt{Spectrogram} (1D and 2D spectra). 

These classes allow access to the original data
along with associated metadata and provide appropriate convenience functions to
enable data analysis and visualisation. For each of these classes, the data is
stored in the \texttt{data} attribute while the metadata is stored 
in the \texttt{meta} attribute. (Curently, \texttt{LightCurve} does 
not support the \texttt{meta} attribute.) It is possible to instantiate the
data types from various
different sources: e.g., files, URLs, arrays or time ranges.  In order 
to provide instrument-specific specialisation, all the core SunPy data types 
support subclassing; e.g., \texttt{Map} has an \texttt{AIAMap} 
sub-type for data from the SDO/AIA instrument. 
Data visualisation is provided by two functions: \texttt{peek()}, for quick 
plotting, and \texttt{plot()}, for plotting with more fine-grained control that 
integrates with \texttt{matplotlib}.


This section will give a brief overview of the \textit{current} functionality 
of each of these data types.

\subsection{Visualisation}
\label{subsec:Viz}
As demonstrated in this section, the core SunPy datatypes 
include visualisation methods that are tailored to that data type. 
These visualisation methods all currently utilise the \texttt{matplotlib} 
package, and are designed in such a way that they integrate well with 
the \texttt{pyplot} functional interface of \texttt{matplotlib}.

This design philosophy makes the behaviour of SunPy's visualisation 
routines intuitive to those who already understand the \texttt{matplotlib}
interface, as well as allowing the use of the standard 
\texttt{matplotlib} commands to manipulate the plot parameters, such as the 
title.
