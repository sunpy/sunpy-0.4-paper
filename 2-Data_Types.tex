\section{Core Data Types}
The primary focus of SunPy is to provide data structures 
that are specifically designed for the primary varieties of solar physics data, namely
images, time series, and spectra. SunPy provides three core data
types using Python classes:
\texttt{Map} (2D spatial data),
\texttt{LightCurve} (1D temporal series)
and \texttt{Spectrum}/\texttt{Spectrogram} (1 and 2D spectra). 

The classes provide access to the original data
along with associated metadata and provide appropriate convenience functions to
enable data analysis and visualization. For each of these classes, the data is
stored in the \texttt{.data} attribute while the metadata is stored 
in the \texttt{.meta} attribute. It is 
possible to instantiate the data types from various different 
sources: \textit{e.g.}, files, URLs, arrays or time ranges.  In order to provide
instrument-specific specialisation, all the core SunPy data types support specialisation;
\textit{e.g.}, \texttt{Map} has an \texttt{AIAMap} sub-type. 
Data visualisation is provided by two functions: \texttt{peek()}, for quick plotting,
and \texttt{plot()}, for more fine-grained control plotting that integrates with 
\texttt{matplotlib}.
% LightCurve does NOT have a meta attribute.  Needs to be fixed in the
% re-write of LightCurve


This section will give a brief overview of the \textit{current} functionality 
of each of these data types.

\input{2-2-Lightcurve}
\input{2-3-Spectra}

\subsection{Visualisation}
\label{subsec:Viz}
As has been demonstrated in this section, the core SunPy datatypes 
include visualisation code that is tailored to that data type. 
These visualisation methods all currently utilise the matplotlib 
package, and are designed in such a way that they integrate well with 
the \texttt{pyplot} functional interface of \texttt{matplotlib}, as demonstrated in 
Figure \ref{code:mpl_1}.

%schriste - I vote for removing all of the following code as being too down in the weeds
\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{minipage}{0.49\columnwidth}
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg]{python}
import sunpy.map
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Read in a aia file using SunPy
aiamap = SunPy.map.Map('aia.fits')

#Create the figure and axis 
#explicitly
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.subplot()

#Create a image plot with raw data
im = ax.imshow(aiamap.data,...)
#add a colour bar
plt.colorbar(im,ax=ax)

#Add a title
plt.title("My AIA plot")
plt.show()
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.49\columnwidth}
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg]{python}
import SunPy.map
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Read in a aia file using SunPy
aiamap = SunPy.map.Map('aia.fits')

#Create the figure and axis 
#explicitly
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.subplot()

#Plot the AIA map
im = aiamap.plot(axes=ax)
#add a colour bar
plt.colorbar(im,ax=ax)

#Add a title
plt.title("My AIA plot")
plt.show()
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\caption{A simple example of how SunPy's plotting functions provide similar 
behaviour to the \texttt{matplotlib.pyplot} interface.}
\label{code:mpl_1}
\end{listing}

This design philosophy makes the behaviour of SunPy's visualisation 
routines intuitive to those who already understand the \texttt{matplotlib}
interface, as well as allowing the use of the standard 
\texttt{matplotlib} commands to manipulate the plot parameters, such as the title.

%ayshih - I recommend removing the following sentences
More technically what is done in the plotting routines is firstly, to 
make sure that the current state of the figure and axes is maintained 
in the same way as it is inside the \texttt{pyplot} functions. For 
\texttt{Map} this means setting \texttt{pyplot.sci()} or set current 
image, so that \texttt{plt.colorbar()} 
automatically detects the plotted \texttt{AxesImage} object. 
Secondly, it also means returning the same type of object as the 
\texttt{pyplot} interfaces function, \textit{i.e.} for \texttt{Map} 
it returns the \texttt{AxesImage} instance which is the same type of 
return as \texttt{pyplot.imshow}.
