\section{Solar Data Search and Retrieval}\label{sec:retrieval}

Several well-developed resources currently exist which provide remote access to

and event databases. SunPy provides support for these resources via the 
\texttt{net} subpackage. In the following subsections, we describe a number of 
these resources and how to use them in SunPy.
